              The clock slowly ticked. Tick-tock, tick-tock. The room was so quiet we could hear the second-hand inch around the clock. The entire class sat staring and focusing their eyes on it as if it would magically speed up. Why? Because at exactly 3:00 p.m. school was over, not just for the day, but for the year. We couldn’t even pretend to be paying attention to the teacher’s final speech.

                At the very instant the second bell rang we all hopped into line as fast as possible. Yes, the upcoming summer was exciting, but we were all even more excited for the afternoon to come. No one even felt the need to say their goodbyes because we all knew we’d be seeing each other later. And where would we all be seeing each other? Luna Park.

                When I think of Luna Park, I think about my memories there more than anything else. Yes, there are some fun rides and attractions but the most special part is spending time with friends and family and then reflecting upon those memories. When I look at the Cyclone I see the first time I was daring enough to ride it with my dad and I am reminded of how I kept on going back on because I loved it so much. When I look at the Wonder Wheel I remember the time I was in a swinging car with only my friends and we thought it was broken and we were going to fall. These memories surround me and comfort me every time I enter the park.

                While I go to one school and have my small circle of friends and family, so does everyone else. Even though it seems to me like I am the only person with this connection to Luna Park and the joy it brings me every year, I know there are thousands of other kids who have had similar experiences to me. It can be hard to realize that everybody else has their own story and own path, just like I do. Even though I didn’t know the majority of the kids, we all had a shared experience, which connected us to form a community.

                We might have not known each other’s names and have not talked more than just briefly but on a ride, all of the surrounding strangers turn into my friends, even if just for a minute. During the ride, everyone screams and holds on really tight, and then after everyone feels that same rush of adrenaline. These experiences can connect us and remind us how alike we all are even when it seems like we may be lost or alone. Each year I would recognize more and more faces because there were so many people just like me who had this tradition. This formed a sense of community because not only were we all having fun at an amusement park, but we all were there to celebrate something together. I could go up to anyone and immediately connect over a ride or over excitement for the summer.

                I truly realized how common of a tradition this was when I made new friends in middle school and realized they had been doing the same thing as me for years. They lived miles away, in Downtown Brooklyn, and I had still crossed paths with them each year. Who knows, I may have been on the same ride with them, or may have been in the same restaurant. When I first found this out I almost didn’t believe it was true. My experiences and memories correlated with Luna Park had been so personal and special that this idea seemed crazy to me. Thinking back, this was because I’d been in my own little bubble for so long and I hadn’t realized that I wasn’t the only one experiencing Luna Park in such a personal way.
